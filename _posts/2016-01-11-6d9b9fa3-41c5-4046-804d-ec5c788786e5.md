Excellent resources to sink your teeth into: 

1. [d.school Bootcamp: The Student Experience][0](03:14)

[Stanford's d.school][1]is another heavy lifter in the world of design thinking. Watch grad students from all disciplines begin to embrace the design thinking process. I love seeing the open and colorful d.school space -- forget the old-fashioned lecture hall!
2. [Tools at Schools 1.Project Introduction][2](03:07)

First segment of a[six-episode series][3]about a workshop where eighth-grade students in New York City are asked to dream up the basic elements of the classroom of the future using design thinking. Great example of a school-business partnership.
3. [_Design & Thinking_Official Trailer][4](02:28)

_[Design & Thinking][5]_is a documentary released this year about design thinking. I haven't seen it yet, but I'm loving the approach -- the cacophony of voices, from engineers to educators, cyclists to CEOs, is compelling. Bonus trivia:[this film was crowd-funded by Kickstarter][6]. Check out a[list of upcoming screenings on their blog][7].
4. [Design Thinking Teacher Training Video // Part 1 of 2][8](08:02)

[The Henry Ford Learning Institute (HFLI)][9]is a nonprofit that supports an innovative network of small schools in Michigan. HFLI developed a design thinking middle/high school curriculum. They have recently started sharing out their work and conducting design thinking boot camps. More on[design thinking at HFLI here][10], and you can[see Part 2 of this video here][11].
5. [Hedge School Dublin][12](02:30)

Part of last year's[Innovation Dublin Festival][13], Hedge School Dublin was a two-week long design camp for secondary school students, where the young people came up with ideas for 21st-century learning. More information at[the Hedge School Dublin website][14].
6. [Emily Pilloton: Teaching design for change][15](16:44)

In this compelling TED Talk, Emily Pilloton describes her journey from city-dwelling designer to rural teacher. Pilloton moved to North Carolina in 2009 to engage high school students in design thinking to transform their community. She[came back to Berkeley in summer 2012][16]. Visit her nonprofit,[Project H Design][17], for more resources.
7. [Design Thinking - Taught by Theresa McGee][18](03:05)

This Chicago art and technology teacher was one of twelve national recipients of a[PBS Teachers Innovation Award][19]for using design thinking with her elementary school students. Watch her students at work in this short video.
8. [Design Thinking in Educational Administration Courses][20](02:13)

Grad students at Iowa State University learn how to address school improvement issues using design thinking. This snapshot of their process shows how design thinking can be applied to a variety of kinds of problems.
